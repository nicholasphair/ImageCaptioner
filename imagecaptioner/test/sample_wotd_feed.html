    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p>"Whether there was real efficacy in these nostrums, and whether their author himself had faith in them, is more than can safely be said," wrote 19th-century American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne, "but, at all events, the public believed in them." The word <em>nostrum</em> has often been linked to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quack#h5">quack</a> medicine and false hopes for miracle cures, but there's nothing deceitful about its etymology. It has been a part of English since at least the early 17th century, and it comes from the Latin <em>noster</em>, meaning "our" or "ours." Some think that specially prepared medicinal concoctions came to be called <em>nostrums</em> because their purveyors marketed them as "our own" remedy. In other words, the use of <em>nostrum</em> emphasized that such a potion was unique or exclusive to the pitchman peddling it.</p>
